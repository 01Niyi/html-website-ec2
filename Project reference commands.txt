ssh into the ec2 instance. to do that: first, put the ec2 key pair in the home directory of your local machine. 
then, for mac ssh use the following command to ssh into your mac machine:
ssh -i <ec2_keypair name>  ec2-user@<public ipv4 of ec2 instance>
e.g., ssh -i ec2_key.pem ec2-user@3.83.148.225

then, run the following commands in ascending order to install the html website on the ec2 instance

sudo su
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
cd /var/www/html
wget https://github.com/azeezsalu/techmax/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cp -r techmax-main/* /var/www/html/
rm -rf techmax-main main.zip
